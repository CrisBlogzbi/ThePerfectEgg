# The Perfect Egg

Welcome to The Perfect Egg. I gathered my cooking knowledge accumulated over the years and my refound love for coding to bring you an easily understandable site about how to correctly cook an egg.

## Features

### Body

![Size Responsive](/assets/readme-images/size-responsive.png)

The site consists of 4 main sections:

- The Title, which includes an Image and a Lightgreen background,
- The Introduction and Poaching Method,
- The Sauté Method,
- The Boiling Method and Social Media Links.

I decided to keep to the theme of the mighty egg. And such, I made:

- the background grey, the shell,
- the bottom and top layer of the navigation bar + the background of the sides of the tables white, the eggwhites,
- the background of the navigation bar + the background of the middle of the tables yellow, the yolks.

### Navigation Bar

- Residing on top of the page in a fixed position, the navigation bar allows the user to quickly go from one part of the page to the other.
- When hovered over, it changes size, color and a green border with round edges appears around it.
- I decided to make it fixed, so that the user doesn't have to scroll all the way to the top of the page, but can directly go from one cooking method to the other.

### The Cooking Methods

Each cooking method includes:

- A short definiton of the method.
- Different dishes that can be cooked using the method with their unique, fitting image.
- Each dish has their defined table, which helps the user understand: what to do, why to do it and some aditional information.

### End Note + Footer

- The end note is a farewell to the user and a reminder to check out the socials. I feel that the user will have a sweeter good-bye, if we wish them something nice at the end.
- The footer includes the socials. Each social link has an interactive icon, that changes size and turns into their respective color when hovered over. Blue for Facebook, teal for Twitter, red for Youtube, and pink for Instagram.

### Unfixed Bugs

- The Social media icons sometimes don't load. Not sure if it's a mistake in the code, or just the icons in themselves being buggy/heavy to load.

## Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

- In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
- In the "Code and automation" click on the "Pages" tab.
- Choose the Source as "Deploy from branch" and Branch "main/root"
- Choose an allowed custom domain and click on "save"
- You will find the link to your site at the top of the page.
