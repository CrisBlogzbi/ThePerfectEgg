        <p>Now, you might be thinking:"But it's just a boring egg, what's so interesting about it?"</p>
        <p>I've studied cooking in Switzerland for 3 years and trust me when I tell you, and egg can be very interesting
            and different to cook...
            just like a potato.. but that's a different story. :P</p>

            with them starting... Now!</p>

            <h2 id="poach">Poaching Method</h2>
            <p id="main-method">Poaching means to cook something in a liquid, mostly water, at a temperature between
                65 and 75°C. However, that doesn't always need to be the case and you will see what I mean in a
                minute.</p>

        <div>
            <h4>Poached Eggs</h4>
            <p>Poached eggs are a beautiful and tasty way of cooking eggs. The eggwhites solidify, forming a sort of
                layer for the yolk to stay runny.</p>

                <tr>
                    <td>You will need 2 bowls, one to crack the eggs in, one to keep them in. Crack the Eggs in one bowl
                        one by one, without damaging the yolk.</td>

                        Poached eggs are amazing served on toast, spinach or on rice with a little bit of buttersauce,
                        currysauce

            <h4>Scrambled Eggs</h4>
            <p>Yep scrambled eggs are poached. They are one of the exceptions to the rule, because you don't poach them
                in a liquid,
                but because of the low temperature used and the fact that, well, the mass is liquid, you call it
                poaching.</p>

                        diffent preferenced when it comes to the taste of salt on eggs.</td>

            <p>This is one of my favourites. But i have to say I don't always have the patience to make the dish. As any
                other egg dish, it's really good for breakfast or brunch.</p>

                    dishes, for example.</td>
                <td>Buttering the cocottes keeps the eggs and inlay from sticking.</td>
                <td>Depending on your oven and how you like the eggs, you can play a bit with the time. You don't have
                    to cover them, but if you don't, i would suggest to put a bowl of boiling water at the bottom of the
                    over, so that the eggs are firm at the top.</td>

            <h2 id="saute">Sauté Method</h2>
            <p id="main-method">Sauté or Searing, is cooking something in a pan with little to no external fat from 160
                to 240°C. Our little egg friends are, once again, an exception to the rule. The temperature being the
                reason. Because you don't always want to cook them at a too high temperature, even if you sear them.</p>

        <div>
            <h4>Fried Eggs</h4>
            <p>I disagree with the english name for this dish. Because to fry something you need to cover it entirely
                with oil, which you don't do to "fried eggs". But nonetheless, let's get to it!</p>

            <h4>French Omelette</h4>
            <p>Omellete is what most people call scrambled eggs and I can see why, however, it's wrong. It's because you
                don't whisk your omellete to the very end, you want your omellete mass to stay together while having a
                firm, almost runny consistency in the middle.</p>

                        them, in case of eggshels falling in the mass.</td>
                    <td>You can add your garnish either in the raw mass or on top of the omellete before closing it. I
                        like to use tomatoes, chicken, onions and potatoes. I also like to brush a bit of butter on the
                        closed omellete, it makes it have a bit of a glow.</td>
