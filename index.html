            <h2 id="poach">Poaching Method</h2>
            <p class="main-method">Poaching means to cook something in a liquid, mostly water, at a temperature between
                65 and 75°C. However, that doesn't always need to be the case and you will see what I mean in a
                minute.</p>

            <p>Poached eggs are a beautiful and tasty way of cooking eggs. The eggwhites solidify, forming a sort of
                layer for the yolk to stay runny.</p>
