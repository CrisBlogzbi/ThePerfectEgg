            <h2 id="poach">Poaching Method</h2>
            <p id="main-method">Poaching means to cook something in a liquid, mostly water, at a temperature between
                65 and 75°C. However, that doesn't always need to be the case and you will see what I mean in a
                minute.</p>

        <div>
            <h4>Poached Eggs</h4>
            <p>Poached eggs are a beautiful and tasty way of cooking eggs. The eggwhites solidify, forming a sort of
                layer for the yolk to stay runny.</p>

            <h4>Scrambled Eggs</h4>
            <p>Yep scrambled eggs are poached. They are one of the exceptions to the rule, because you don't poach them
                in a liquid,
                but because of the low temperature used and the fact that, well, the mass is liquid, you call it
                poaching.</p>

                    to cover them, but if you don't, i would suggest to put a bowl of boiling water at the bottom of the

                to 240°C. Our little egg friends are, once again, an exception to the rule. The temperature being the
                reason. Because you don't always want to cook them at a too high temperature, even if you sear them.</p>

            <h4>Fried Eggs</h4>
            <p>I disagree with the english name for this dish. Because to fry something you need to cover it entirely

            <p>Omellete is what most people call scrambled eggs and I can see why, however, it's wrong. It's because you
                don't whisk your omellete to the very end, you want your omellete mass to stay together while having a
                firm, almost runny consistency in the middle.</p>
